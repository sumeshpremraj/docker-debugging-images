# Ops Toolkit

This is a set of lean Docker images with some essential debugging and ops tools included. There are Alpine and Debian based images - you can add extra binaries as you require.

I use it when debugging problems in Kubernetes clusters and I need a shell with the usual suspects (curl, dig, DB clients, vim etc.) within the cluster.
